NAME
    Module::Install::RequiresList - Report prerequisite modules and version
    numbers

SYNOPSIS
    In your Makefile.PL:

        use inc::Module::Install;
        ...
        requires_list;
        ...

    From the command line:

        > perl Makefile.PL
        > make requires-list

DESCRIPTION
    This module adds a target to your Makefile for listing the modules
    required.

    The report is broken into sections: Required, Recommended, Build
    Requires, and Author Requires.

    For each module listed, the report prints 3 versions: the version you
    are requesting, your installed version and the CPAN version.
